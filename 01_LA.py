# Explanation of symbols:
# - G: A set (a collection of elements)
# - ⊗: A binary operation (can be addition, multiplication, etc.)  
# - G × G → G: This means ⊗ takes two elements from G and outputs another element in G.
# - ∀: "For all" (universal quantifier)
# - ∈: "Belongs to" (membership in a set)
# - ∃: "There exists" (existential quantifier)
# - e: The identity (neutral) element in G
# - x⁻¹: The inverse of x (an element in G that undoes x under ⊗)

# Definition  (Group)
# A group is a set G with an operation ⊗ : G × G → G that satisfies:

# 1. Closure: ∀x, y ∈ G, the result of x ⊗ y is also in G.
#    (i.e., G is closed under the operation ⊗)

# 2. Associativity: ∀x, y, z ∈ G, we have (x ⊗ y) ⊗ z = x ⊗ (y ⊗ z).
#    (i.e., the operation ⊗ is associative)

# 3. Neutral element (identity element): There exists an element e ∈ G
#    such that ∀x ∈ G: x ⊗ e = x and e ⊗ x = x.
#    (i.e., e acts as an identity for all elements in G)

# 4. Inverse element: For every x ∈ G, there exists an element y ∈ G
#    such that x ⊗ y = e and y ⊗ x = e, where e is the identity element.
#    (i.e., every element has an inverse, often written as x⁻¹)

# in simple words a group is a set of elements with an operation that satisfies the above 4 conditions

# numpy implementation of all four conditions :

G = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])  # A set of elements
mod = 5 # Modulo operation : why : because we are working with a cyclic group : what that means : if you go beyond the last element then you come back to the first element

# 1. closure:
# ⊗: Modulo operation
closure = all((x+y)%mod in G for x in G for y in G) # for all x and y in G the result of x ⊗ y is also in G
print("Closure:", closure)

# 2. associativity : 
associativity = all(((x+y)%mod+z)%mod == (x+(y+z)%mod)%mod for x in G for y in G for z in G) # for all x, y, z in G, we have (x ⊗ y) ⊗ z = x ⊗ (y⊗z)
print("Associativity:", associativity)

# 3. Neutral element: Find e such that x ⊗ e = x for all x ∈ G
identity = [e for e in G if all((x + e) % mod == x for x in G)] # there exists an element e ∈ G such that ∀x ∈ G: x ⊗ e = x and e ⊗ x = x
print("Neutral element (identity):", identity)  # Should print [0]

# 4. Inverse element: Find y such that x ⊗ y = e for all x ∈ G
inverse_elements = {x: [y for y in G if (x + y) % mod == 0] for x in G} # for every x ∈ G, there exists an element y ∈ G such that x ⊗ y = e and y ⊗ x = e, where e is the identity element
print("Inverse elements:", inverse_elements)  

# to sum all this up in simple words : a group is a set of elements with an operation that satisfies the above 4 conditions ; the modulo operation is a good example of a group

"""
Closure: ensures adding any two elements of G still gives an element in G.

Associativity: checks if (x + y) + z == x + (y + z) (mod 5).

Identity element: finds e such that x + e = x (mod 5). Here, e = 0.

Inverse elements: finds y for each x such that x + y = 0 (mod 5).

money in a bank account (group vs vector space)
group perspective (only addition, no scaling):
imagine you have a bank account where you can only deposit or withdraw fixed amounts, say $10 at a time.

you start with $50, you add $10 → now you have $60.

you remove $10 → now you have $50 again.

you’re stuck using multiples of $10—you can’t scale the numbers, just add or subtract in fixed steps.

this is like a group: you have an operation (addition), but you're confined to the specific set of amounts you can reach.

vector space perspective (addition + scaling):
now imagine you can multiply your money—maybe by investing it or applying interest rates.

if you invest your $50 and it doubles, now you have $100.

if you lose half, you have $25.

you’re not just adding/subtracting fixed amounts anymore—you’re scaling your money up and down.

this is a vector space: you can still add money, but now you can also scale it up or down (like multiplying a vector by a scalar).

key difference:
groups = just adding/subtracting (fixed steps).

vector spaces = adding and stretching/shrinking (scaling).

Operations in a Vector Space
Vector Addition (+):

Adding two vectors gives another vector in the same space.

Example: Moving two steps in one direction and three steps in another still keeps you in the same "space."

Scalar Multiplication (·):

Multiplying a vector by a number (scalar) stretches or shrinks it.

Example: Doubling a velocity vector makes you move twice as fast in the same direction.

#    - Every vector has an inverse: x + (-x) = 0

# 2. Distributivity:
#    - λ * (x + y) = λ * x + λ * y  # Scaling a sum is the same as scaling each part
#    - (λ + ψ) * x = λ * x + ψ * x  # Adding scalars before multiplying works the same way

# VECTOR SUBSPACES  

# a vector subspace is a smaller set of vectors within a vector space  
# it behaves just like a vector space but is "contained" inside the bigger space  
# no matter how you add or scale vectors in the subspace, you never leave it  

# vector subspaces are smaller sets inside a vector space that stay closed under vector operations  
# basically, if you add two vectors in the subspace or scale them, you're still inside the subspace  

# for U to be a subspace of V:
# 1. it must have the zero vector (0 must be in U)
# 2. it must be closed under vector addition (x + y is still in U)
# 3. it must be closed under scalar multiplication (scaling a vector in U still gives a vector in U)

# example:  
# in 3D space, a flat plane passing through (0,0,0) can be a subspace  
# because adding two vectors in the plane keeps you in the plane  
# and scaling a vector still keeps you in the plane  
# The intersection of arbitrarily many subspaces is a subspace itself.

# but a random tilted surface or a plane not passing through the origin?  
# not a subspace, because scaling can take you outside it  

####### check animation and more details for it at animations\01_LA\vector_subspace.py

# 1. the entire space V itself
# 2. the zero subspace {0} (just the origin)

# - for a set to be a subspace, it must be closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication.
# - if a set fails this, it is NOT a subspace.

# examples:
# - if a set does not include the zero vector, it is not a subspace.
# - if adding two vectors in the set gives a result outside the set, it is not a subspace.

# LINEAR INDEPENDENCE

# vectors = elements of vector space

# first we will look into linear combination 

# linear combination notes

# a **linear combination** is when we scale and add vectors to create new vectors.

# given vectors x1, x2, ..., xk in a vector space V:
# any vector v that can be written as:
# v = λ1 * x1 + λ2 * x2 + ... + λk * xk
# (where λ1, λ2, ..., λk are scalars) is a linear combination.

# key properties:
# - the **zero vector** is always a linear combination:
#   0 = 0 * x1 + 0 * x2 + ... + 0 * xk
# - we focus on **non-trivial** linear combinations,
#   meaning at least one λi is **not zero** when representing 0.

# example:
# in R^2, vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1) can form any vector (a, b) by:
# (a, b) = a * (1, 0) + b * (0, 1)

# linear independence

# trivial linear combination : when all scalars are 0

# Linear Dependence & Independence

# Linear Combination:
# Any vector can be made by scaling & adding other vectors.

# Linearly Dependent:
# - At least one vector in the set can be made from the others.
# - Some information is redundant.
# - Example: (1,0), (0,1), and (2,2) → (2,2) is just 2*(1,1).

# Linearly Independent:
# - No vector in the set can be created using the others.
# - All vectors add something unique.
# - Example: (1,0) and (0,1) in 2D → Can't form one using the other.

# Shortcut: If removing a vector doesn’t change the "span," it was dependent.

# Properties of Linear Dependence & Independence

# 1. Vectors are either dependent or independent—no middle ground.
# 2. If at least one vector is zero or two vectors are identical → they are dependent.
# 3. If one vector is a multiple of another → they are dependent.
# 4. A set of k ≥ 2 vectors is dependent if at least one can be written as a combination of the others.

# Checking Independence: Gaussian Elimination
# - Write vectors as columns of a matrix A.
# - Perform Gaussian elimination to get row echelon form.
# - Pivot columns = independent vectors.
# - Non-pivot columns = dependent vectors (can be written as a combination of pivot columns).

# Shortcut:
# - If every column is a pivot column → vectors are independent.
# - If at least one column is not a pivot column → vectors are dependent.

# to remind  a pivot column is a column in a matrix that has the first nonzero entry (a leading 1 after row reduction) in a new row, indicating an independent vector.

# linear combinations

b1 = np.array([1,0])
b2 = np.array([0,1])

# scalars  
λ1, λ2 = 2, -3  

# linear combination: λ1 * b1 + λ2 * b2  
v = λ1 * b1 + λ2 * b2  
print(v)  # Output: [ 2 -3 ]

# 2. Checking Linear Independence
# Vectors are linearly independent if the only solution to Ax = 0 is x = 0.
# We check this using NumPy’s np.linalg.matrix_rank().
A = np.array([[1,2],[3,6]]) # two vectors as columns

rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(A)

if rank == A.shape[1]: # number of columns
    print("linearly independent")
else:
    print("linearly dependent")

# rank of matrix is the number of linearly independent columns in the matrix

# Finding a Pivot Column

from sympy import Matrix  

A = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 4], [0, 0, 0]])  # Third column is not a pivot
rref, pivot_columns = A.rref()
print("Pivot Columns:", pivot_columns)  # Output: (0, 1)

# 4. Checking if a Vector is in a Subspace
# To see if a vector 𝑣
# v belongs to a subspace spanned by some basis vectors, solve Ax = v.

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Basis vectors as columns
v = np.array([5, 11])  # Target vector

try:
    x = np.linalg.solve(A, v)  # Solve Ax = v
    print("v is in the subspace, solution:", x)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    print("v is NOT in the subspace")  # If A is singular, no solution

# It checks if `v` is a linear combination of `A`'s columns by solving `Ax = v`; if successful, `v` is in the subspace.
